    "\n",
    "1. The images should have some degree of bandpass filtering\n",
    "applied, particularly to remove high frequencies, and different choices here\n",
    "may impact outcome. The bandpass filter also complicates matters because,\n",
    "since the images to be registered will differ in scale and these scale\n",
    "differences are unknown, any bandpass filter will necessarily attenuate\n",
    "different features between the images. For example, the log-polar transformed\n",
    "magnitude spectra don't really look \"alike\" in the last example here. Yet if\n",
    "you look closely, there are some common patterns in those spectra, and they\n",
    "do end up aligning well by phase correlation as demonstrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Images must be windowed using windows with circular symmetry, to remove\n",
    "the spectral leakage coming from image borders. There is no clearly optimal\n",
    "choice of window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we note that large changes in scale will dramatically alter the\n",
    "magnitude spectra, especially since a big change in scale will usually be\n",
    "accompanied by some cropping and loss of information content. The literature\n",
